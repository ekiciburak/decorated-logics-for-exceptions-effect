# decorated-logics-for-exceptions-effect

Two different ways to formalize exceptions effect in the decorated logic: core and programmers'. The latter one aims to formalize a typical programmers' language of exceptions; the only constraint is that there is a single exception name allowed. Whereas the former one exploits the categorical duality between states and exceptions: duals of equations by Plotkin and Power (for states effect) have been translated into the current context and proven: see Proofs.v
